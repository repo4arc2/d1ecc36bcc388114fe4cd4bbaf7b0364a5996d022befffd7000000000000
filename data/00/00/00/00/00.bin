10
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,350
《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision.

11
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,580
你可真是爱管闲事
Snooper's gonna snoop.

12
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,710
我的孩子呢
Where are my children?

13
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,370
它们是如尼文  旺达
These are runes, Wanda.

14
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,370
只有施如尼文咒的女巫能施展魔法
Only the witch that cast the runes can use her magic.

15
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,040
幻视不在了
Vision was gone.

16
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,720
但你希望他回来
But you wanted him back.

17
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,560
他是我拥有的一切
He's all I have.

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,570
问题就在这里  旺达
Well, that's just it, Wanda.

19
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,350
他不是你的  他是我们的
He isn't yours. He's ours.

20
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,850
海沃德为了达到目的
Hayward's gonna burn Westview

21
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,680
不惜把西景镇烧成灰烬
to the ground just to get what he wants.

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
不要让他把你变成凶手
Don't let him make you the villain.

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,230
或许我就是凶手
Maybe I already am.

24
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,220
这是混沌魔法  旺达
This is Chaos Magic, Wanda. 

25
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,510
所以你是绯红女巫
And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,580
放开我  放开我兄弟
Get off of me! Let go of my brother!

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,030
我的超能力在这里可以用  你忘了吗
My powers work out here, or did you forget?

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,030
不  亲爱的  我就等着你发力呢
No, dear. I'm counting on it.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,870
不
No!

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,510
回房间
Go to your room.

31
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,670
-绝不  我们要留下  -妈妈  我们能帮忙
- No way, we're staying with you. - Come on, Mom, we can help.

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,680
-听妈妈的  孩子们  -快去
- Listen to your mother, boys. - Now!

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,260
我夺走不配拥有魔法之人的法力
I take power from the undeserving.

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,850
这是我的特色
It's kinda my thing.

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,180
你的小红脑瓜显然是自不量力
You're clearly in over your little red head.

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,080
不如你把你的魔法交给一个
So, why don't you surrender your magic

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,310
知道该怎么用的人吧
to someone who knows what to do with it?

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,750
我会允许你自己留着这可悲的
And I'll let you keep this pathetic little corner

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,130
世界一角
of the world all to yourself.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,260
怎么样
What do you say?

41
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,520
幻视
Vision?

42
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,250
真的是你吗
Is it really you?

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,710
旺达
Wanda...

44
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,910
他们还说你很强大呢
And I was told you were powerful.

45
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,600
孩子们呢
Where are the boys?

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,910
他们在房子里  很安全
They're in the house. Safe.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,170
幻视
Vision...

48
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,850
我该告诉你一切的
I should've told you everything.

49
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,850
我一意识到我做了什么就该告诉你
The moment I realized what I had done. 

50
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,150
没事  旺达
It's all right, Wanda.

51
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,070
我知道你为何创造这个世界  但这...
I know why you made this world, but this...

52
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,240
-我能挽救的  -是吗
- I can fix it. - Can you?

53
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,190
这可尴尬了
Oh, this is awkward.

54
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,500
你的前任和你男友一同亮相一个派对
Your ex and your boyfriend together at the same party.

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,610
你要选谁呢  旺达
Who are you gonna choose, Wanda?

56
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,330
幻视  这是我们的家
Vision, this is our home.

57
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,260
那我们就为之而战吧
Then let's fight for it.

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,500
旺达
Wanda!

59
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,900
旺达
Wanda!

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,900
-旺达  -别浪费唾沫了  宝贝
- Wanda! - Don't waste your breath, babe.

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,860
你在这里没人能听到
No one can hear you from in here.

62
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,740
我们不能和平解决吗
Might we resolve this peacefully?

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,370
旺达·马克西莫夫必须被消灭
Wanda Maximoff must be neutralized.

64
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,640
你必须被销毁
You must be destroyed.

65
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,080
看来是"不能"了
A "No," Then.

66
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,140
{\an8}重新获取武器

67
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,640
是我最喜欢的联调局探员呢
Hey, it's my favorite member of the bureau.

68
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,420
重新确认任务目标
Reconfirm mission objective.

69
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,890
他的系统过载了  长官
His system is overloaded, sir.

70
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,610
我完全接不进去
I can't get anything through.

71
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,590
还在控制之中吗
Still under control?

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,240
就我看来  他还属于我们
As far as I can tell, He's still ours.

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,200
你别想把这事盖过去
You'll never be able to cover this up.

74
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,630
我不用那么做
I won't have to.

75
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,440
旺达取消了她的剧
Wanda cancelled her show,

76
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,610
所以没有录像
so there's no footage

77
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,140
证明有过不止一个幻视
proving there was ever more than one Vision.

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,880
还有天剑局总部的监控
Oh, there's S.W.O.R.D. HQ security tape

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,910
肯定还有篡改证据
and evidence of tampering, no doubt.

80
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,110
等我解决了旺达·马克西莫夫  就不会有人在乎了
No one's gonna care once I've eliminated Wanda Maximoff.

81
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,020
他们会相信那个
They'll believe that the vision

82
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,850
从西景废墟里钻出来的幻视
who emerges from the Westview rubble

83
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,520
就是她违法地企图复活的那个
is the same one she illegally tried to bring back to life.

84
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,040
他们会感谢我找回了如此高价值的武器
They'll thank me for recovering such a valuable asset.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,180
你也可以为这份胜利出力  吉米
You could be a part of that victory, Jimmy.

86
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,980
如果你能更有眼界[幻视]的话
If only you had a little more vision.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,050
真好笑  海沃德
That's a good one, Hayward.

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,480
好  我信你了
Okay, I'm convinced.

89
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,200
问题是  我在匡提科的同事
Trouble is, my friends at Quantico

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,230
可能会对你的计划有些异议
will probably have something to say about your plan

91
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,550
等他们一小时内到后
when they arrive inside the hour.

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
你在唬我
You're bluffing.

93
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,590
是吗
Am I?

94
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,940
我们没什么可说的了
We're done here.

95
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,070
"瞧好了"
Oh. "Flourish."

96
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,040
-喂  -克里夫  是詹姆斯·吴
- Hello? - Cliff. Uh, James Woo.

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,680
我这里有点麻烦
Hey, I've got a situation and

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,120
不知你能不能一小时内赶到
I was hoping you could get here inside the hour?

99
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,110
真逗
Guy's really funny.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,970
别开枪
"Don't shoot.

101
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,800
我只是信使
"I'm just the messenger."

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,430
旺达  你以前可没对付过别的女巫
Wanda, you've never been up against another witch before.

103
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,310
你知道吗
Did you know there's an

104
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,790
《黑暗神书》里有一整章都是关于你的
entire chapter devoted to you in the Darkhold?

105
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,510
那是诅咒之书
That's the book of the damned.

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,980
{\an8}纯天然配方  使用大自然母亲的力量
贼亮

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,330
"绯红女巫并非天生  而是锻造而成
"The Scarlet Witch is not born, she is forged.

108
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,810
她不属于女巫团  不需要念咒"
"She has no coven, no need for incantation."

109
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,560
我不是女巫  我不施咒
I'm not a witch. I don't cast spells.

110
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,380
没人教过我魔法
No one taught me magic!

111
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,370
你的法力胜过至尊法师
Your power exceeds that of the Sorcerer Supreme.

112
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,790
你的天命注定是毁灭世界
It's your destiny to destroy the world.

113
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,760
我才不是你说的那样
I'm not what you say I am.

114
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,340
是吗
Oh, really?

115
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,090
-旺达  -多蒂
- Wanda? - Dottie?

116
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,110
我叫莎拉
My name is Sarah.

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,690
我有个女儿  她八岁
I have a daughter. She's eight.

118
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,260
或许她可以跟你的儿子们做朋友
Maybe she could be friends with your boys.

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,790
如果你喜欢这样的故事线
If you like that storyline.

120
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,570
他们甚至可以做学校霸王
Or, uh, the school bully, even.

121
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,030
真的  什么都行  求你把她从房间里放出来
Really, anything. If you could just let her out of her room.

122
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,170
让我抱抱她  求你
If I could just hold her, please.

123
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,060
你对她做了什么  你在逼她说这些话
What are you doing to her? You're making her say this.

124
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,160
她是你的人偶  我只是剪了她的提线
She's your meat puppet, I just cut her strings.

125
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,640
这都是什么东西
What is this stuff?

126
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,540
这是我的男人洞
This is my man-cave.

127
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,120
放松的地方
A place to chillax, you know,

128
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,730
让妹子去惹麻烦
while the missus is stirring up trouble.

129
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,930
{\an8}西景

130
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,820
你喜欢史蒂文·西格尔吗
You a fan of Steven Seagal?

131
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,760
{\an8}拉夫·博纳

132
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,310
艾格妮丝不住在这里
Agnes doesn't live here.

133
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,840
你住在这里
You do.

134
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,840
你是拉夫·博纳吗
You're Ralph Bohner?

135
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,870
勃起
Boner.

136
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,990
她是怎么控制你的
How is she controlling you?

137
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,190
你想再来比划比划吗
You wanna tussle again?

138
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,530
喵  她可真凶啊
Meow, she's feisty!

139
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,490
天啊  求求你饶了我
Oh, God! Please, spare my life!

140
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,510
见到你很高兴  拉夫
Nice to meet you, Ralph.

141
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,710
你还能看到他们吗
Can you see them anymore?

142
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,340
看不到
No.

143
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,580
你...怎么了
Hey, what... What's wrong?

144
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,360
我们得赶紧走
We've got to go.

145
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,630
我不认得镜子中的自己  还有我说话的声音了
I don't recognize my face in the mirror, my voice when I speak.

146
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,120
我以前都在努力对抗你
I used to try to resist you,

147
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,300
但现在我都记不清为什么了  你还记得吗
but now, I can't remember why. Do you?

148
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,570
我丈夫出差了
My husband's on a business trip.

149
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,150
告诉他我爱他  永远不要再回到这里
Tell him I love him and not to come back here ever.

150
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,330
-我好累  -不  你没事的
- I'm exhausted. - No, you're fine.

151
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,900
你没事的  你们都...你们都会没事的
You're fine. You're all... You're all going to be fine.

152
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,470
你让我们睡去了  我们都在做你的噩梦
When you let us sleep, we have your nightmares.

153
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,920
不  不是那样的
No, that's not true.

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,870
我...我让你们安全地待在这里
I've... I've kept you safe in here.

155
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,920
你  你们感觉...
You... You feel...

156
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
你们感觉很平静
You feel at peace.

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
-我们只感受到你的痛苦  -不
- We feel your pain. - No.

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,330
-你的悲伤对我们来说是毒药  -不  停下
- Your grief is poisoning us. - No, stop!

159
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,630
-拜托  放了我们吧  -我想回家
- Please, let us go. - I wanna get back home.

160
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,580
-放了我们  -停下
- Let us go. - Stop.

161
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,300
放了我们吧  求你了  旺达
Let us go, please, Wanda.

162
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,390
求你了
Please!

163
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,940
求你了
Please!

164
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,330
不  停下
No! Stop.

165
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,690
停下  我很抱歉
Stop, I'm sorry.

166
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,600
如果你不愿意放了我们  杀了我们吧  求你了
If you won't let us go, just let us die. Please.

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,750
-我会...  -求你了
- I will... - Please.

168
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,640
我会放了你们的  我会的  我会的
I will let you go. I will. I will.

169
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,110
是什么阻止了你
What's stopping you?

170
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,450
用你的能力  动手啊
Use your power and do it now.

171
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,380
英雄不会折磨人的
Heroes don't torture people.

172
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,300
走吧  你们都赶紧走
Go! All of you, now. Go!

173
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,610
{\an8}沐浴润滑油

174
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,240
{\an8}花冠电影院
汤豪瑟之门
为关系失衡带来乐趣

175
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,760
就是现在  我们进去
This is it. We're going in.

176
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,250
你马上就要明白了
Now you'll see.

177
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,060
{\an8}新鲜

178
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,900
什么
What?

179
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,700
旺达
Wanda!

180
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,210
-妈妈  -救命  妈妈
- Mom!- Help, Mom!

181
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,910
你明白了吗
Now, do you see?

182
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,150
你让你的家人和这个扭曲的世界捆绑在一起
You tied your family to this twisted world,

183
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,380
如果这里消失了  他们也不会再存在
and now one can't exist without the other.

184
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,910
-妈妈  -妈妈
- Mom! - Mom!

185
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,130
孩子们
Boys!

186
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,350
是拯救西景镇  还是你的家人
Save Westview or save your family.

187
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,600
-妈妈  救命  -救救我
- Mom! Help! - Help! Please!

188
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,580
{\an8}西景镇

189
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,670
-妈妈  救命  -妈妈
- Mom, help! - Mom!

190
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,210
妈妈
Mom!

191
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,040
妈妈  你没事吧
Mom! Are you okay?

192
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,080
不
No!

193
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,040
妈妈  你没事吧
Mom? Are you okay?

194
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,530
多么温馨啊
How sweet.

195
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,530
爸爸
Um... Dad?

196
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,660
听着  孩子们
Listen, boys.

197
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,830
我和你们妈妈一直没让你们做好应对这一刻的准备
Your mother and I never really prepared you for this.

198
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,650
但你们生来就会了
But you were born for it.

199
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,790
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

200
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,880
我的编程指令是摧毁幻视
My programming directive is to destroy the Vision.

201
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,900
但我不是真正的幻视  只是一个特定条件下的幻视
But I'm not the true Vision. Only a conditional Vision.

202
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,830
我要求你详细说明
I request elaboration.

203
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,160
过了几个世纪  还是一样的故事
Same story, different century.

204
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,910
我们这样的女人
There'll always be torches

205
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,400
永远会遇到火把和干草叉  旺达
and pitchforks for ladies like us, Wanda.

206
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,920
孩子们  去对付军方的人
Boys, handle the military.

207
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,520
妈妈马上回来
Mommy will be right back.

208
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,070
不不不  别开枪
No, no, no! Stand down!

209
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,870
-能力不错  -我也喜欢你的
- Nice tricks. - I like yours, too.

210
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,510
在监狱里玩得开心
Have fun in prison.

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
你知道形而上学领域中的
You are familiar with the thought experiment the Ship of Theseus

212
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,670
忒修斯之船实验吗
in the field of identity metaphysics?

213
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,460
当然
Naturally.

214
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,540
忒修斯之船是一个博物馆中的藏品
The Ship of Theseus is an artifact in a museum.

215
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,000
随着时间的推移  船上的木板腐烂了
Over time, its planks of wood rot

216
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,240
全都换成了新的
and are replaced with new planks.

217
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,380
当拆除最后一块原始木板后  那还是忒修斯之船吗
When no original plank remains, is it still the Ship of Theseus?

218
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,290
其次  如果拆除的木板
Secondly, if those removed planks are

219
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,090
重新翻修组合  没有霉斑了
restored and reassembled, free of the rot,

220
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,590
那还是忒修斯之船吗
is that the Ship of Theseus?

221
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,450
两艘都不是真正的忒修斯之船
Neither is the true ship.

222
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,560
两艘都是真正的忒修斯之船
Both are the true ship.

223
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,240
那我们的看法一致
Well, then, we are agreed.

224
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,460
但我没有意识宝石
But I do not have the Mind Stone.

225
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,540
我身上也没有任何原来的部件
And I do not have one single ounce of original material.

226
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,050
也许锈斑就是记忆
Perhaps, the rot is the memories.

227
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,500
那些磨损就是旅途
The wear and tear are the voyages.

228
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
是忒修斯亲自触碰过的木板
The wood touched by Theseus himself.

229
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,420
我没有保存记忆
I have not retained memories.

230
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,810
但是你有数据
But you do have the data.

231
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,310
只是不让你触及而已
It is merely being kept from you.

232
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,020
一个更方便控制的武器
A weapon to be more easily controlled.

233
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,560
但你当然是真正的幻视
But, certainly, you are the true Vision,

234
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,570
因为你是这么认为的
for you believe yourself to be.

235
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,860
我曾经的确是这么认为的
That was once the case.

236
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,360
但见到你后  我不再那么想了
But upon meeting you, I have been disabused of that notion.

237
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,430
作为一个碳基合成人
As a carbon-based synthezoid,

238
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,750
想要清除你的记忆存储可没有那么简单
your memory storage is not so easily wiped.

239
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,310
可以让我试试吗
May I?

240
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,660
我是幻视
I am Vision.

241
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,230
爸爸
Dad!

242
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,410
孩子们  孩子们  孩子们
Boys, boys, boys, boys!

243
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,500
爸爸
Dad!

244
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,300
不
No.

245
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,230
不
No.

246
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,130
你和我之间的区别在于
You see, the difference between you and me,

247
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,160
你是故意的
is that you did this on purpose.

248
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,450
不
No!

249
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,150
不不不
No, no, no! No, no!

250
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,430
不要  求你了  求求你
Oh, please! I beg you! I beg you!

251
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,300
不不不
No! No, no!

252
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,480
不不不
No! No! No!

253
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,120
旺达  旺达
Wanda. Wanda.

254
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
旺达  旺达·马克西莫夫
Wanda. Wanda Maximoff...

255
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,310
你是女巫
You are a witch.

256
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,980
你是女巫
You are a witch.

257
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,990
女巫
Witch...

258
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,140
你...
You...

259
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,300
是绯红女巫
...are the Scarlet Witch.

260
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,530
早已注定  早已注定  早已注定
So it is written. So it is written. So it is written.

261
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,970
我就说吧
Told you so.

262
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,850
混乱的预兆
Harbinger of Chaos.

263
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,990
一如预言  早已注定
So, it is foretold. So it is written.

264
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,430
一如预言
So, it is foretold.

265
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,170
你赢不了的  旺达
You can't win, Wanda.

266
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,890
不是输在法力  而是因为知识
Power isn't your problem, it's knowledge.

267
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,910
把你的法力给我
Give me your power

268
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,120
我会修改你原咒中的缺陷
and I will correct the flaws in your original spell.

269
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,400
你和你的家人
And you and your family,

270
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,270
还有西景镇的居民
and the people of Westview

271
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,160
就都可以一同过着宁静的生活
can all live together in peace.

272
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,610
也不会再有人必须经历这种痛苦
And no one will ever have to feel this pain again.

273
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,770
连你都不必
Not even you.

274
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,740
早已注定  一如预言
So it is written. So it is foretold.

275
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,730
拿去吧
Take it!

276
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,900
我不想要
I don't want it.

277
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,660
旺达  你在干什么
Wanda, what are you doing?

278
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,150
来啊  旺达
Come on, Wanda!

279
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,700
来啊  旺达  逃出你的命运
Come on, Wanda! Escape your fate!

280
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,670
卸下你的重担
Release your burden!

281

282
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,090
妈妈
Mom!

283
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,100
我们的约定
About our deal...

284
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,210
一旦念出咒语  就永远无法改变
Once cast, a spell can never be changed.

285
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,190
你造出的这个世界将永远破碎
This world you made will always be broken.

286
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,860
就像...
Just like...

287
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,100
你自己
you.

288
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,250
如尼文
Runes.

289
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,690
"在某个空间内
"In a given space,

290
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,700
只有施如尼文咒的女巫能施展魔法"
only the witch who cast them can use her magic."

291
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,360
谢谢你教给我
Thanks for the lesson...

292
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,330
但我用不着你告诉我
But I don't need you to tell me

293
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,090
我是谁
who I am.

294
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,010
不不不
No. No. No. No!

295
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,370
不
No! No!

296
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,560
天啊  你不知道自己做了什么
Oh, God. You don't know what you've done.

297
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,250
好孩子
Good girl.

298
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,990
现在呢
So, what now?

299
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,260
你要把我关到什么地方去吗
You just gonna lock me up somewhere?

300
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,870
不  不是"什么地方"
No. Not "Somewhere."

301
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,010
这里
Here.

302
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,540
这里
"Here"?

303
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,010
我会给你你选择的角色
I'll give you the role you chose.

304
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,710
多管闲事的邻居
The nosy neighbor.

305
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,250
不  求你了
No. Please...

306
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,630
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

307
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,920
你一点也不抱歉  你太残忍了
No, you're not. You're cruel.

308
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,970
你...你根本...
You... You have...

309
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,750
你根本不知道你释放出了什么
You have no idea what you've unleashed.

310
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,320
你会需要我的
You're gonna need me.

311
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,130
-到时候我也知道去哪里找你  -等等
- If I do, I know where to find you. - Wait.

312
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,570
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait. Wait...

313
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,270
你好  亲爱的
Hiya, hon.

314
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,040
你穿的衣服可真有料
Say, that's some kinda getup you're wearing.

315
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,000
是我没有关炉子  还是你太热辣了
Did I leave the oven on, or is that just you, hot stuff?

316
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,260
你从此住在这里
You live here now.

317
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,260
没有人会再来打扰你
No one will ever bother you.

318

我会再来看你的  艾格妮丝
I'll be seeing you, Agnes.

320
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
除非我先看到你  亲爱的
Not if I see you first, hon.

321
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,180
-妈妈  -妈妈
- Mom! - Mom!

322
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,820
-过来  -你没事吧
- Come here... - Are you okay?

323
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,030
看来我们梦想中的家
So, it would appear that our dream home

324
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,180
又变回了废墟
has been reduced to a fixer-upper.

325
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,810
我知道你会安排好一切的
I know you'll set everything right.

326
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,430
只是不包括我们

不包括我们
Not for us.

329
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,480
也该是时候了
Hmm. It's time.

330
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,500
我们回家吧
Should we head home?

331
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,610
好
Yeah.

332
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,390

家人是永远的

341
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,650
不管我们怎么尝试  都不可能真正地离开彼此
We could never truly leave each other, even if we tried.

342
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
你们知道的  对吗
You know that, right?

343
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,400
晚安  孩子们

我...
Oh, I, uh...

350
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,920
我以前读到过
I read somewhere

351
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,780
在黑暗中说再见会带来噩运
that it's bad luck to say goodbye in the dark.

352
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,420
你才没有呢
No, you didn't.

353
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,380
是的  是的
No, no.

354
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,330
也许我没读到过  也许...
Perhaps not. Perhaps...

355
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,620
我只是想要看清你的脸
I just wanted to see you clearly.

356
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,850
怎么
And?

357
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,510
就看到你了
And there you are.

358
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,780
旺达  我知道我们不能一直这样
Wanda, I know we can't stay like this.

359

但在我消失前  我必须要知道
But before I go, I feel I must know.

360
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,920
我是什么
What am I?

361
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,250
你  幻视
You, Vision...

362
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,270
是栖息在我体内的意识宝石碎片
are the piece of the Mind Stone that lives in me.

363
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,070
你是我用电线  血与骨
You are a body of wires and blood and bone 

364
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,570
创造出的身体
that I created.

365
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,740
你是我的悲伤和希望
You are my sadness and my hope.

366
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,200
但最重要的是  你是我的爱
But mostly, you're my love.

367
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,920
我曾是个没有身体的声音
I have been a voice with no body.

368
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,070
后来有了非人类的身体  现在
A body, but not human. And now...

369
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,200
我是一段成真的回忆
a memory made real.

370
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,010
谁知道我下次会变成什么
Who knows what I might be next?

371
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,440
我们以前道别过
We have said goodbye before,

372
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,210
所以理所当然
so it stands to reason...

373
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,490
我们会再次问好
We'll say hello again.

374
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,570
再见  亲爱的
So long, darling.

375
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,530
他们永远不会知道你为他们牺牲了什么
They'll never know what you sacrificed for them.

376
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,650
那不会改变他们对我的看法
It wouldn't change how they see me.

377
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,320
还有你  难道
And you, you don't...

378
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,000
你不恨我吗
You don't hate me?

379
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,620
如果我有这个机会和你的超能力
Given the chance and given your power,

380
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,730
我会复活我妈妈
I'd bring my mom back.

381
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,000
我知道我会
I know I would.

382
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,200
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

383
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,820
我带来了那么多痛苦
For all the pain I caused.

384
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,250
我知道
I know.

385
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,200
我还不了解这种能力
I don't understand this power.

386
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,500
但我会的
But I will.

387
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,770
再见  莫妮卡
Goodbye, Monica.

她说"弱者才会做汇报"
Uh, something about "debriefs are for the weak."

399
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,910
不过  这可多亏了她
